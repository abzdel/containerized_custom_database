## Objectives of the project
- My main objective here is to build a **containerized, efficient script** that builds a database locally, establishes a connection with Python, and inserts outside data we found from Kaggle.
- I also have a Jupyter notebook with various questions I wanted to answer regarding this data with queries to actually answer them.
